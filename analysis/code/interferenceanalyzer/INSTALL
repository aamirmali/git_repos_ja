This project contains C code for a Python module called intanalyzer. To install
the module on a x86_64 architecture (64 bit Intel):

cd /
tar xzf PATH_TO_THIS_PROJECT/intanalyzer_x86_64.tar.gz

To install on i686 architecture (32 bit Intel):

cd /
tar xzf PATH_TO_THIS_PROJECT/intanalyzer_i686.tar.gz

If you want to rebuild from source, or if your architecture is not supported,
run:

sudo python setup.py install
